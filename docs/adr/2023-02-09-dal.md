# 2023-02-09 - Data abstraction layer

## Context

Blablabla

## Decision

Instead of using the Doctrine ORM, we decide to use our own DAL.

Each entity consists of an entity definition and an entity itself. In the definition, the required fields are defined, including important properties such as uniqueness, mandatory field, primary key, etc.
The entity includes the getter and setter methods. IDs as well as mandatory fields such as creation and modification date are added automatically.

The input is validated via serializers defined in the corresponding field.

It is important that entities can be extended.

## Consequences

Describe which code to change, etc.

## [optional] tl;dr

Short summary in one or two sentences.
